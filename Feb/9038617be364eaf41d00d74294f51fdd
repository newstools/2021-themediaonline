[ADVERT] We are in the process of disposing all film material that has been held in our stores for the past decade. Should anyone own this film material, or should you know of someone who owns any of it, you are requested to please contact Sasani Studios before 30 April 2021, to lay claim to the material. Sasani will provide a list of all the film material being held and proof of ownership will be requested prior to releasing any material. Any film material remaining at Sasani after the deadline of 30 April 2021 will be removed and disposed of. Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms?

Koketso Sachane, Sheila Ndikumana, and Kutlwano Masote join the SAfm line-up as presenters as of April 2021. The only national talk radio station in South Africa, with the largest footprint, SAfm promised to remain relevant and ultimately deliver more on its mandate to grow the station’s listenership. “We are excited to welcome new presenters to the SAfm family, and we wish them well,” said SAfm acting station manager, Kina Nhlengethwa. “They all bring a wealth of knowledge to the station.  It is vital to keep abreast and adapt to the ever-changing media landscape and serve our audiences holistically.” Changes to the 2021 line-up include Asanda Beda taking over the early morning slot, Sound Awake 03h00-05h00 weekdays, from 1 April, while Mandla Shongwe moves to the late-night Music Show on weekends. A well-known talk host, Koketso Sachane, will anchor the View Point on Wednesday and Thursday from 20:00 – 22:00, live from the Cape Town studios. Sheila Ndikumana takes over the early weekend slot, 03h00-06h00, to bring a taste of music from the African continent. Listeners can look forward to the familiar voice of Kutlwano Masote, with the best classical music on Saturday & Sunday, 16h00-19h00. The rest of the weekdays and weekend schedule will remain the same. Monday – Friday Saturday & Sunday Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms?

Her journey took off at the age of 12, at church, where she discovered her singing capabilities and she took her talents to stage. After years of unfolding this gift, Gina joined the South African Music Award (SAMA) winning, Tshwane Youth Gospel Choir in 2009. Mabasa rose to fame in 2013 when she became part of Team North West in the South African choirs show, Clash of the Choirs, mentored by the legend himself, Sipho Hotstix Mabuse. In the same year, she worked on the Samsung S4 Launch with South African recording artists RJ Benjamin, AKA (Kiernan Forbes), Ayo Solanke, Neil and Itu Tshabane. She was also a choir member in South African Idols season 9. In 2015, she furthered her musical studies at the Vusi Mahlasela Foundation, focusing on music theory and instrument (bass guitar) with Jonas Gwangwa. It was later that same year that she cast in a play, AMANDLA the Musical. As an exceptional talent, Mabasa knows all corners of her capabilities, and that her dreams are valid and she will grace greater stages.

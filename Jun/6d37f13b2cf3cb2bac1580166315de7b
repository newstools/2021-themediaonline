Media Imperatives is a useful media planning tool that utilises FUSION2020 to clearly show how people really consume media. It has been pre-coded onto the FUSION2020 survey and it is already available on both Telmar and Clear Decisions. More on Media Imperatives here. In this practical workshop PRC Research Consultant Pete Langschmidt will explain how Media Imperatives can assist in planning for improved results.

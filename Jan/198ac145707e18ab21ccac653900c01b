[PRESS OFFICE] The Business Day Focus 4.0 conference – presented by Arena Events (a division of Arena Holdings) and Cold Press Media – is now in its second year and will take the shape of a Digital Dialogue series that focuses on the fast-tracking of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technology development, transformation, and adoption under the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Business Day Focus 4.0 Digital Dialogue series is a think-tank platform where South African business leaders can be exposed to new ways of working, through the implementation of technology to digitise the workforce. It will also focus on the recalibration of strategies and business models to aid organisations in embracing a digital transformation imperative. Taryn Westoby, Head of Arena Events, says: “The success of Business Day Focus 4.0 can be ascribed to three elements: the reputation and credibility of Business Day among business leaders and key decision makers, thereby attracting a relevant and engaged audience for partners; the unique pull that Business Day has in engaging the most influential minds and industry experts as panelists; and a deep understanding of the issues that are being faced by business, to ensure they are addressed in a much-needed public forum.” The first four episodes in the Business Day Focus 4.0 Digital Dialogue series already kicked off in 2020: “We are inviting organisations who wish to showcase their leadership, and the positive impact of their technology and business solutions, to get involved.  We welcome an opportunity to hear from those experiencing success in their field,” Westoby says.

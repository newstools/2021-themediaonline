Telenovela Isibaya came to an end on 2 April after a successful eight-year run. Now the team at DStv and Mzansi Magic have thanked the cast and crew for “eight years of incredible storytelling and service to the television industry”. And they thanked the fans “who were guests at the weddings, cheered at the SAFTAS and supported stars as they rose to fame, this journey has been a phenomenal one and this is for you”. But for those who missed the long-running tale of two warring families, set in the taxi industry, you can relive the Isibaya journey on Mzansi Magic’s website or Catch-Up on all things Isibaya on Showmax.

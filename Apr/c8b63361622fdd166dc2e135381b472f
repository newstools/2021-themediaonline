In what is an extremely important year to acknowledge and commend the industry, the organisers of MOST are pleased to announce that you can officially vote for the 12th annual MOST Awards, which opens today and will stay live until 4 June 2021. Don’t miss your opportunity to
contribute to continued excellence and growth in the industry by completing the
Media Owner or Media Agency survey. To access the online survey go to www.themediaonline.co.za and look for the ‘Click here to Vote’ button at the top of the homepage. Or alternatively, visit www.quicklink.co.za/votemost “The MOST Awards continues to gauge the importance and fundamentals of service delivery between buyers and sellers of the media landscape. We’re excited to be opening voting today – the MOST Awards is no less relevant now than it ever has been over the past 12-years,” said Brad Aigner, founder of research outfit, Freshly Ground Insights, which is conducting the survey. The user-friendly, online survey asks
respondents to select the companies that they wish to vote for and requires
that they are scored against a number of specific performance criteria.
Companies are then ranked according to this data. Every vote counts and adds to
the sample size – the more votes, the more robust the research results and the
more valuable they become for media owners and agencies. For more information or to sponsor the MOST Awards 2021 please contact Melanie Warricker on 072 480 6123 or melanie@ifeelgood.co.za.

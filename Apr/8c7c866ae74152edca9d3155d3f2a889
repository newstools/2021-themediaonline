[PARTNER CONTENT] This month Lifetime, DStv 131, uncovers the real stories behind some big names that we know and love – Wendy Williams, Whitney Houston and Salt ‘N Pepa. We also have a slate of movies based on shocking real-life events and hot new seasons of hit reality shows including; Married at First Sight and Marrying Millions. Twitter recently exploded with the hashtag #WendyWilliamsDay after Wendy
mentioned that 10 April is ‘Wendy Williams Day’ on her US talk show. The video
clip went viral – with everyone wondering out loud who had told the TV
personality that it was her day. We’re owning it – 10 April is after all #WendyWilliamsDay with both her
biopic and documentary airing on Lifetime that day. Wendy Williams: The
Movie (10 April at 19h20) is a brutally honest and intimate look at Wendy’s
life including details about her struggle with addiction and her divorce. This
is followed directly by the feature length documentary, Wendy Williams: What
a Mess! (10 April Saturday 20h50), where she sheds her private persona and
speaks directly to the camera about her tumultuous life and career. In case you missed it Anele from 947 interviewed Wendy Williams recently… listen to the podcast here. We delve into the stories behind some other iconic women in pop culture history with other  ‘Ripped from the Headlines’ movies and doccies this month. In the documentary, Let’s Talk About Salt-N-Pepa on Saturday 17 April, the queens of hip-hop sit down for an intimate discussion about their iconic partnership.
